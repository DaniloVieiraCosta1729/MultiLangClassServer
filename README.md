# MultiLangClassServer
In this project I'll try to create a simple class manager where the user can add, update, remove, and list students, assign them scores, and see the stats of the class and of an individual student. The way I'm going to do this is quite different from the standards, I suppose, because I really want to use some topics that I've learned recently, like C, SQLite, a TCP server, and x86 assembly to create some functions (maybe to manipulate strings so the server can communicate with the browser through HTTP), isolate the SQL operations in another process, and use an AF_UNIX socket for the communication between the server and the database application. The database can also use some sort of inversion of control by calling the SQL instructions through a callback function.
